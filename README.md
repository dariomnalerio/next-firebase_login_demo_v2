# Next-firebase login demo v2

Simple web application made with Next, Express, Prisma, Postgre, Tailwind and Firebase authentication.

With the knowledge obtained in the [first version](https://github.com/dariomnalerio/next-firebase_login_demo) of the app, I wanted to create a better organized and efficient version.

The aim was to learn about how to set up user  authentication with these technologies to use in future  projects.

You must create a firebase project in order to run this program

## Features

- Sign up
- Log in
- Log out
- Edit user info (name, age, email, password)

## Enviroment variables

You can get these values from the firebase console

`NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BUCKET`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID`
`NEXT_PUBLIC_MEASUREMENT_ID`

## Run locally

Clone the project

    https://github.com/dariomnalerio/next-firebase_login_demo_v2

Install dependencies for both the client and the server and start them

    cd client
    npm i
    npm run dev

    cd server
    npm i
    nodemon /server.ts
